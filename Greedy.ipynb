      "The [Knapsack Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knapsack_problem) is a combinatorial optimization problem. In the \"fantasy football\" variation of the knapsack problem, we are trying to determine an optimal selection of players to maximize our team's expected fantasy points. There are two major components to playing fantasy football \"quantitatively.\" The first is building statistical models to predict how many fantasy points a player will produce. The second is determining which players to pick, given their predicted point production and their cost. This notebook will show two approaches for tackling the second task."
